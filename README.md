Website created for my RuneScape clan during the summer of 2008, when I was 14 years old. This project represents my first steps into web development and design. You can view the website here: [Templarios Clan Website](https://matiasrodlo.github.io/templarios/web)

The project was made possible thanks to my uncle, Eduardo Astudillo, who introduced me to web development and design. During that summer, he took me to his software factory ([A2M](https://web.archive.org/web/20110202032110/http://www.a2m.cl/sitio/web/index.php)), where I learned:
- Basic HTML and CSS
- Web design principles
- Adobe Dreamweaver
- Graphic design fundamentals
