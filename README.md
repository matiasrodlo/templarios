# Templarios - RuneScape Clan Website (2008)

A nostalgic website created for my RuneScape clan during the summer of 2008, when I was 14 years old. This project represents my first steps into web development and design.

## About

This website served as the central hub for the Templarios clan in RuneScape, featuring various sections for clan members including:
- Clan meetings and events
- Member registration
- Quest guides
- Clan maps and locations
- Photo gallery
- Chat system
- Member suggestions

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- PHP
- Adobe Dreamweaver
- Basic graphics design

## Project Structure

The website consists of several key components:
- `index.html` - Main landing page
- `miembros.htm` - Clan members section
- `reuniones.htm` - Clan meetings and events
- `questNM.htm` & `questSM.htm` - Quest guides
- `registrate.htm` & `registrateEnvio.php` - Member registration system
- `imagenes/` - Directory containing clan images and graphics
- `grafica/` - Directory for design assets

## Learning Journey

This project was made possible thanks to my uncle Eduardo Astudillo, who introduced me to web development and design. During that summer, he took me to his software factory (www.a2m.cl) where I learned:
- Basic HTML and CSS programming
- Web design principles
- Adobe Dreamweaver usage
- Graphics design fundamentals

## Note

This project serves as a time capsule of my early programming journey and the RuneScape gaming community of 2008. While the code may reflect the web development practices of that era, it represents an important milestone in my learning path.
